# AdditionalRoutes
Edit additional routes under any network service easily and safely.

If a target host is not accessible when you are under multiple network services, you need to edit additional routes.

For example, if your default network service is S1 and a host H1 under service S2 is unreachable, you need to add additional routes under S2.
This action tells the computer that you can access H1 under S2 through this route.
